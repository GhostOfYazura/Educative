# Overviw:
This is a default layout when I am making a review of something I studied in my notation-format which helps me recollect and present information to others.
<br>
# Objective:
To make it clear and quick to share researched information with providing further questions.
<br>
# Summary:
This is what I would normally fill out with what the overview text is saying.
<br>However I might include something extra like, "There is reason for further study, reference the resources."
<br>Keeping in mind that this is to be treated like a journal entry, not a recipe or formula.
<br>
# Difficulties: 
There was no difficulties as an example of this was created earlier today while assisting a friend.
<br>This could also include potential further study that is required to complete the task.
<br>
# Resources:
This would normally be where I either include an image or a link to something.
<br>In this example there is nothing to link yet, but will include in the future. (Don't do this if publishing at work.)
