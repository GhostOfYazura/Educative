# Study Solutions
Solutions I've developed for different challenges, exams or questions inside of study books, websites and courses.

# Educative
**Overview:** *This primarily will be updated with **DevOps for Developers** as the previous courses are past studies, however I am leaving them there as a note of what I have invested into self studying.* 
- DevOps for Developers
- Becoming a C++ Programmer
- Becoming a C# Programmer
- Python for Programmers
- Matplot for Python: Visually Represent Data with Plots

# Books
**Overview:** *This is just a collection of books I've partially read to date. Going forwards as I read a book there will be a bookfile.md describing chapters or pages which I think provide extra clarity or informantion alongside my thoughts. Please note that these are not limited to Programmer but development in general.*
- C++ Primer Plus by Developer Library
- EarthBound by Boss Fight Books


# Courses
**Overview:** *Only public courses will contain details, outside of that it is a collection of my academic achivements. This will exclude non-developer related things.*
- Graduate Diploma in Media by The Academy of Interactive Entertainment.
